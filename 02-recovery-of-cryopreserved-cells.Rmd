# Recovery of cryopreserved cells 

## Instruments

- Biosafety cabinet
- Water bath
- Centrifuge (130 rcf, for 15 mL centrifuge tubes)
- Incubator (37째C, 5% CO~2~)
- Microscope
- Pipettes, etc.

## Materials

- Cryopreserved cells
- Complete media
- 6-well plates; T25, or T75 cell culture flasks
- 15 mL centrifuge tube
- 70% ethanol, etc.

## Steps

1. Set-up the biosafety cabinet (BSC), water bath to **37째C**, and incubator to **37째C with 5% CO~2~**.
    - Pre-warm the growth media in the water bath

3. Pipette 9 mL of warmed complete growth media into the 15 mL centrifuge tube(s).

4. Retrieve the cryopreserved cells, at most two vials at a time. 
   Warm them in the water bath until only a small piece of ice remains, then transfer into the BSC.

5. Quickly pipette cryopreserved cells, now completely thawed, into 15 mL centrifuge tube(s) containing warmed complete growth media.

6. Centrifuge the cells at **24째C and 130 rcf for five minutes** to form a cell pellet.

7. Once the centrifuge is done, dispose of the supernatant by aspirating with a pipette.

8. Resuspend the cell pellet with fresh pre-warmed growth media, and dispense into the 6-well plate or cell culture flask(s).

9. Inspect the flask(s) under a microscope.

10. Gently mix the culture flask(s) and place into the incubator.

## Notes

- When preparing the growth media, mix the FBS by pipetting to eliminate concentration gradients
- When pipetting into cell culture flasks, aspirate 1 mL more than you intend to dispense; this avoids the formation of air bubbles in the culture flask, which may be detrimental to cell growth
- Cell culture flask(s) should be labelled with the name of the cell line, passage number, your name, and the current date
- When mixing cells within a cell culture flask, use vertical up-down and left-right motions; circular motions may gather cells to the flask's center
