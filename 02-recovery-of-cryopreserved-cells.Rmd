# Recovery of cryopreserved cells 

## Instruments

- Biosafety cabinet
- Water bath
- Centrifuge (approx. 125 rcf, for 15ml centrifuge tubes)
- Incubator (37째C, 5% CO~2~)
- Microscope
- Pipettes, etc.

## Materials

- Cryopreserved cells: LoVo, SW1116, HT-29, Caco-2, or HCT 116
- DMEM high glucose (Sigma-Aldrich D5796-500ML) with 10% fetal bovine serum
- T25 cell culture flasks
- 15ml centrifuge tube
- 70% ethanol, etc.

## Steps

1. Set-up the biosafety cabinet (BSC), water bath to **37째C**, and incubator to **37째C with 5% CO~2~**.
    - Pre-warm the growth media in the water bath

2. Retrieve the cryopreserved cells, at most two vials at a time. 
   Warm them in the water bath until only a small piece of ice remains, then transfer into the BSC.

3. Quickly pipette cryopreserved cells, now completely thawed, into 15ml centrifuge tube(s).

4. Quickly pipette **1ml** of fresh pre-warmed growth media drop-by-drop into the centrifuge tube(s).

5. Centrifuge the resuspended cells at **24째C and 130rcf for five minutes** to form a cell pellet.

6. While the centrifuge is spinning, pipette **4ml** of fresh pre-warmed growth media into T25 cell culture flask(s).

6. Once the centrifuge is done, dispose of the supernatant by aspirating with a pipette.

7. Resuspend the cell pellet with **1ml** of fresh pre-warmed growth media, and dispense into the cell culture flask(s).

8. Inspect the flask(s) under a microscope.

9. Gently mix the culture flask(s) and place into the incubator.

## Notes

- When preparing the growth media, mix the FBS by pipetting to eliminate concentration gradients
- When pipetting into cell culture flasks, aspirate 1ml more than you intend to dispense; this avoids the formation of air bubbles in the culture flask, which may be detrimental to cell growth
- Cell culture flask(s) should be labelled with the name of the cell line, passage number, your name, and the current date
- When mixing cells within a cell culture flask, use vertical up-down and left-right motions; circular motions may gather cells to the flask's center
