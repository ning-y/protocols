# Cryopreservation

## Instruments

- Biosafety cabinet
- Water bath
- Centrifuge (approx. 125 rcf, for 15 mL centrifuge tubes)
- Microscope
- Cell freezing container
- -80°C freezer
- Pipettes, etc.

## Materials

- Cells
- Complete growth media
- Freezing media
- Phosphate-buffered saline buffer (PBS)
- Trypsin solution
- 15 mL centrifuge tube(s)
- Cryotube(s)
- 70% ethanol, etc.

## Steps

1. Follow the subculturing protocol up to and including the addition of complete media.

2. Transfer the cell suspension into a 15 mL centrifuge tube.

3. Centrifuge the suspended cells at **24°C and approximately 125 rcf for five minutes** to form a cell pellet.

4. After centrifugation, aspirate and discard the supernatant.

5. Resuspend the cell pellet with pre-warmed freezing media.
    - Gently pipette the cell pellet(s) and suspension(s) using a 1 mL pipette and pipette tip to encourage dissociation.
   Try pipetting 10 to 30 times.
   Aspirate and dispense slowly; and keep the pipette tip away from the tube walls to avoid shearing the celsl.

6. Dispense 1 mL of resuspended cells into each pre-labelled cryotube

7. Place the cryotubes into a cell freezing container and place in a -80°C freezer.
    - A cell freezing container holds cryotubes such that each tube is cooled by 1°C per minute in a -80° freezer.

8. After cooling overnight, the cryotubes can be removed from the cell freezing container and placed into their final storage location.
    
## Notes

- Some growth media or growth media components tend to settle in a concentration gradient when left undisturbed; for these liquids, mix by pipetting to eliminate concentration gradients
- Cryotubes should be labelled with the name of the cell line, passage number, your name, and the current date
- FBS-containing media arrests trypsination because FBS contains trypsin inhibitors
