# Protein quantification (BCA)

This protocol largely follows the Pierce BCA protein assay kit, microplate variation, with 1:20 sample to working solution dilution ratio.

## Instruments

- Microplate
- Microplate reader
- Incubator
- Pipette and pipette tips

## Materials

- RIPA buffer, complete
- Protein samples

## Steps

1. Prepare the stocks in duplicate, using water diluent, according to the manufacturer's protocol.

2. Prepare the blank in duplicate using complete RIPA buffer instead of water.

3. Prepare the samples in duplicate, using RIPA buffer as diluent.
    - Before pipetting, vortex and microcentrifuge the protein solution to mix evenly
    - Keep the protein samples on ice to prevent degradation
    
4. Pipette the stocks, blanks, and samples into microplate wells; add an appropriate amount of working solution.
    - To conserve pipette tips, you may consider first adding the working solution all at once
    
5. Wrap with foil and incubate at 37Â°C using the incubator, for 30 minutes.
    - The manufacturer's protocol may ask that the solution be shaken while incubating, but it is okay to omit the shaking

6. Read the plate using a plate reader.
    a. Use the plate reader on level 6, near the media preparation room
    b. Switch on the plate reader via its power switch at the back of the machine
    c. Log into the PC next to the plate reader, and open "Megallan V7.1 Tecam" via the start menu
    d. When the software starts up, specify the device model but leave all other settings to auto-detect
    e. Skip all registration prompts
    f. Use the predefined "BCA 503" method, under the 503 folder
    g. Insert the microplate with the lid removed
    h. Ensure that shaking is an action within the predfined method
    i. Start the plate reader
    j. Remove the microplate once down, and take a photo of the results

7. If there are still spare wells in the microplate, it can be reused.
   - Keep the microplate in the cabinet at the bench assigned for protein work
