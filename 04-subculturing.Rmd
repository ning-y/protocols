# Subculturing

## Instruments

- Biosafety cabinet
- Water bath
- Incubator (37°C, 5% CO~2~)
- Microscope
- Pipettes, etc.

## Materials

- Cells: LoVo, SW1116, HT-29, Caco-2, HCT 116, or MDA-MB-231
- Growth media: DMEM high glucose (Sigma-Aldrich D5796-500ML) with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS) for LoVo, SW1116, HT-29, Caco-2, HCT 116; or RPMI-1640 with 10% FBS for MDA-MB-231
- Phosphate-buffered saline buffer
- Trypsin solution
- T25/T75 cell culture flasks
- 70% ethanol, etc.

## Steps

1. Set-up the biosafety cabinet (BSC), water bath to **37°C**, and incubator to **37°C with 5% CO~2~**.
    - Pre-warm the growth media, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and trypsin in the water bath

2. Remove cells from the incubator and check for signs of contamination.

4. Wash cells with **(3 mL if T25 / 5 mL if T75)** PBS and decant.
   Repeat the wash for a total of three times.
   On the last wash, aspirate to remove as much liquid as possible.

5. Add **(1 mL if T25 / 2 mL if T75)** of trypsin and incubate for up to ten minutes.
    
6. After incubation, check that cells are detached using a microscope.

7. Add fresh medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS) into the cell culture flask(s).
   Mix and rinse the base of the cell culture flask by pipetting.
    - Adjust the amount of fresh media to add, so that it is easy to pipette 

8. Inspect the flask(s) under a microscope.

9. Gently mix the culture flask(s) and place into the incubator.

## Notes

- When preparing the growth media, mix the FBS by pipetting to eliminate concentration gradients
- When pipetting into cell culture flasks, aspirate 1 mL more than you intend to dispense; this avoids the formation of air bubbles in the culture flask, which may be detrimental to cell growth
- Cell culture flask(s) should be labelled with the name of the cell line, passage number, your name, and the current date
- When mixing cells within a cell culture flask, use vertical up-down and left-right motions; circular motions may gather cells to the flask's center
- FBS-containing media arrests trypsination because FBS contains trypsin inhibitors
