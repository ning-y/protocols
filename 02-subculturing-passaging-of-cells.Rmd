# Subculturing/passaging of cells

## Instruments

- Biosafety cabinet
- Water bath
- Incubator
- Microscope
- Serological pipette and stripettes
- Pipettes and pipette tips
- Cell culture flasks and 15ml tubes

## Materials

- Cells, to be subcultured/passaged
- Growth media, as appropriate for the cell line
- Phosphate-buffered saline buffer
- Trypsin solution and FBS
- 70% ethanol

## Steps

1. Set-up the biosafety cabinet (BSC), and water bath to 37Â°C.

2. Remove cells from the incubator and check for signs of contamination.
    - Signs of contamination include opaque media visible to the naked eye, or strange debris under the microscope

3. Decant the spent media.
    - You may also choose to aspirate the spent media

4. Wash with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer and decant.
   Repeat the wash for a total of three times.
   On the last iteration, aspirate rather than decant, in order to remove as much solution as possible.
    - For T25 flasks, use 3ml of PBS; or 5ml for T75 flasks
    - To avoid contamination, avoid placing the stripette tip into the flask opening, since the flask is already cultured
    - As above, you may also choose to aspirate the spent media

5. Add the trypsin solution, tighten the cell culture flask cap(s) and incubate for five minutes.
    - For T25 flasks, use 1ml of trypsin; or 2ml for T75 flasks
    - Incubate for no more than five minutes

6. Using a microscope, check that cells are detached.
    - Detached cells appear circular and mobile

7. Add fresh medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS) to arrest the trypsination process, and transfer into a 15ml tube. 
   Mix by pipetting.
    - For T25 flasks, use 1ml of media; or 2ml for T75
    - FBS inhibits trypsin; otherwise a trypsin inhibitor is required

8. Prepare new culture flask(s), pipetting 1ml short of the recommended volume of fresh media.
    - The appropriate number of culture flasks will depend on the recommended subcultring ratio
    - Cell culture flask(s) should be labelled with the name of the cell line, passage number, your name, and the current date
    - The recommended amount may vary across cell lines; for MDA-MB-231, for example, a T25 flasks should hold 5ml of fresh media while T75 flasks should hold 12ml of fresh media
    - When pipetting, aspirate 1ml more than you intend to dispense; this avoids the formation of air bubbles in the culture flask, which is detrimental to cell growth
    - The reserved 1ml will be used to resuspend the cell pellet later

9. Transfer the cells from 15ml tube to new culture flask(s).
