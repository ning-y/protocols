# Subculturing/passaging of cells

## Instruments

- Biosafety cabinet
- Water bath
- Incubator
- Microscope
- Serological pipette and stripettes
- Pipettes and pipette tips
    - Including extended 1ml pipette tips which can cover the length of the cell culture flask(s)
- Cell culture flask(s)

## Materials

- Cells, to be subcultured/passaged
- Growth media, as appropriate for the cell line
- Phosphate-buffered saline buffer
- Trypsin solution and FBS
- 70% ethanol

## Steps

1. Set-up the biosafety cabinet (BSC), and water bath to 37°C.
    - Warm the growth media and phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) buffer
    - Trypsin can be administered cold (4°C)

2. Remove cells from the incubator and check for signs of contamination.
    - Signs of contamination include opaque media visible to the naked eye, or strange debris under the microscope

3. Decant the spent media.
    - You may also choose to aspirate the spent media

4. Using the serological pipette, wash with PBS and decant.
   Repeat the wash for a total of three times.
   On the last iteration, aspirate rather than decant, in order to remove as much solution as possible.
    - For T25 flasks, use 3ml of PBS; or 5ml for T75 flasks
    - As above, you may also choose to aspirate the spent media

5. Add the trypsin solution, tighten the cell culture flask cap(s) and incubate for five minutes.
    - For T25 flasks, use 1ml of trypsin; or 2ml for T75 flasks
    - Incubate for no more than five minutes

6. While the cells are incubating, prepare new culture flask(s), pipetting 1ml short of the recommended volume of fresh media.
    - The appropriate number of culture flasks will depend on the recommended subcultring ratio
    - Cell culture flask(s) should be labelled with the name of the cell line, passage number, your name, and the current date
    - The recommended amount may vary across cell lines; for MDA-MB-231, for example, a T25 flasks should hold 5ml of fresh media while T75 flasks should hold 12ml of fresh media
    - When pipetting, aspirate 1ml more than you intend to dispense; this avoids the formation of air bubbles in the culture flask, which is detrimental to cell growth
    - The reserved 1ml will be used to resuspend the cell pellet later

7. After the five minute incubation, check that cells are detached using a microscope.
    - Detached cells appear circular and mobile

8. Add fresh medium containing fetal bovine serum (FBS) into the cell culture flask(s) to arrest the trypsination process.
   Mix and rinse the base of the cell culture flask by pipetting. 
    - For T25 flasks, use 1ml of media; or 2ml for T75
    - FBS inhibits trypsin; otherwise a trypsin inhibitor is required

9. Transfer the cells from the old to new culture flask(s).
