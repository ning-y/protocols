# Common techniques

## Asceptic technique

### Fundamentals

- In bottles and tubes, avoid letting the liquid within the container come into contact with the cap even while the cap is on; this is easier if you always hold bottles by their caps
- After using a freshly aliquoted reagant, write your name on the cap so that contamination, should it happen, can be more easily traced

- Stripettes and pipette tips that have touched any part of any container containing any cell culture should never be reused.
